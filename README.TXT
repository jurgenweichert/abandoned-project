# abandoned-project
Why was the project discontinued?  Why the MT4 platform is already obsolete.  Today we have a lot of good and FREE scripts for the MT5 platform :)  Its parameters are mentioned in the README.TXT file THIS FILE!

Leave everything selected at 0 (off) your Expert Advisor will be well optimized : ) (DO NOT TOUCH!)
Expert Advisor customization parameters - Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive and Daytrade:

Standard count at 1 means lot of 0.1 (0 lot of 0.01)

Alorithm at 1 means standard and optimized level!

Algorithm at 2 means unoptimized level (but still acceptable)

Algorithm at 3 means INSANE LEVEL! (play this game)

Algorithm at 4 means DAYTRADE level - Please turn ON and OFF here!
